# heurestic-PSO-algorithm
  Implementation of heurestic PSO(Particle swarm optimization) algorithm for continous problem.

  The resource allocation task consists in optimizing the distribution of three
containers with poison in an area of 100x100 with 12 wasp nests to kill as many as
the greatest number of them.
The algorithm is designed to randomly generate the initial positions of the containers, and then
optimize their location, taking into account the effectiveness of individual containers separately and their
common effect.
